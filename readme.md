Pinterest Clone, made as part of FCC curicculum and Chingu project.  
Description: The Beer-Badger project will be a Pinterest-like app where Chingu members will be able to post their projects instead of images like in Pinterest. It will include options for sorting, searching, liking, among others.  
  
To do:   
Phase 1: Implement user stories of “Build a Pinterest Clone” challenge of FCC  
 + As an unauthenticated user, I can login with Twitter.  
 - As an authenticated user, I can link to images.  
 - As an authenticated user, I can delete images that I've linked to.  
 - As an authenticated user, I can see a Pinterest-style wall of all the images I've linked to.  
 - As an unauthenticated user, I can browse other users' walls of images.  
 + As an authenticated user, if I upload an image that is broken, it will be replaced by a placeholder image.  
  
Phase 2: Add extra features to reach the goal:  
 - Add Google and GitHub authentication.  
 - Change the focus of the app from images to projects: We can add info to each post like repo url, comments by the author, category, keywords of used libraries, etc.  
 - Add the possibility of choose favorites post.  
 - Add the feature to like a post/project (like Github’s stars)  
 - Add a filtering and sorting option based on tags, user, likes, category, etc.  
 - Add “Chingu Featured”, Chingu seal of approval or something like that to projects that deserve recognition.
